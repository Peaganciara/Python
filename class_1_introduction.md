### Numerical types

A Python shell can therefore replace your pocket calculator, with the basic arithmetic operations:
1. "+" = Sum,
2. "-" = Subtract,
3. "*" = Multiplication, 
4. "/" = Division, 
5. "%" = Modulo natively implemented 


```python
7 * 3.
```




    21.0




```python
type(7)
```




    int




```python
type(3.50)
```




    float




```python
7*3.5
```




    24.5




```python
2**10
```




    1024




```python
7+3
```




    10




```python
8 % 3
```




    2




```python
10% 3
```




    1




```python
7/3
```




    2.3333333333333335



#### Type conversion (casting):


```python
float(1)
```




    1.0



#### Integer division


```python
3 / 2 
```




    1.5



### Containers
1. List
2. Strings
3. Dictionary
4. Tuple


```python
import pandas as pd
```


```python
pd.read_csv()
```


```python
peagan = 10
jose = 25

```


```python
peagan*jose
```




    250




```python
peagan = 2
jose = 14
```


```python
peagan**jose
```




    16384



names represent variables
